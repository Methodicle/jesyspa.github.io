title: The Category of Containers
---

During my work on my [master thesis], I spent some time experimenting with containers (referred to as command structures there) and interaction structures.  Since most of this didn't make it into the final version, I thought it'd be fun to write a few blog posts about what I found.  The material on containers is well known, and implemented in the [Agda standard library] in [Data.Container].  The material on interaction structures is known to some extent, but I have not been able to find a notion of an interaction structure morphism in the literature.
